# AGENTS.md — OpenEmuARM64

Instructions for AI coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, etc.) working in this repository.

## Read First

Before doing any work, read `.claude/CLAUDE.md` for full project context, repo structure, build instructions, and known work areas.

---

## Ground Rules

1. **Never commit directly to `master`.** Always work on a feature branch (`fix/description` or `feat/description`).
2. **Build before committing.** Run an `xcodebuild` check on any Swift/ObjC changes before staging a commit.
3. **Don't rewrite files wholesale.** This is a large, complex Xcode project. Make surgical changes. Rewriting `.pbxproj` or large ObjC files without understanding them will break the build.
4. **Respect the flattened architecture.** Submodule directories (`Nestopia/`, `BSNES/`, etc.) are regular directories — do not attempt to re-initialize them as git submodules.
5. **Do not commit build artifacts.** No `.o` files, derived data, `.app` bundles, or build logs.

## Language and Tooling

- **Swift 6.2.4** — strict concurrency is enforced. Use `@MainActor`, `Sendable`, and structured concurrency correctly.
- **Objective-C** — many core files are ObjC. Bridge headers are in place. Don't break them.
- **Xcode 26.3** — use `xcodebuild` for CLI builds. The primary workspace is `OpenEmu-metal.xcworkspace`.
- **No package manager** — no SPM, no CocoaPods, no Carthage. Dependencies are vendored or flattened submodules.

---

## Build Command

```bash
xcodebuild \
  -workspace OpenEmu-metal.xcworkspace \
  -scheme OpenEmu \
  -configuration Debug \
  -destination 'platform=macOS,arch=arm64' \
  build 2>&1 | tail -30
```

A clean build is the definition of "passing." Run this before every commit touching source files.

## File Organization

| What you're touching | Where it lives |
|----------------------|---------------|
| Main app logic | `OpenEmu/*.swift` and `OpenEmu/*.m` |
| Shared protocols/types | `OpenEmu-SDK/` |
| UI components | `OpenEmuKit/` |
| Metal shaders | `OpenEmu-Shaders/` |
| Emulator cores | `[CoreName]/` (top-level dirs) |
| Build scripts | `Scripts/` |
| Xcode project | `OpenEmu/OpenEmu.xcodeproj/` |

## PR Guidelines

- Target branch: `master` on `bazley82/OpenEmuARM64` (upstream)
- PR title format: `fix: description` / `feat: description` / `chore: description`
- Include what was broken, what was changed, and how to verify it
- For core-specific fixes, note which systems are affected and whether you tested with a ROM

---

## What NOT to Do

- Do not modify `project.pbxproj` manually unless you know exactly what you're changing — it's a large generated file and merge conflicts are painful
- Do not add new dependencies without discussion — the project intentionally has no package manager
- Do not remove or rename existing core directories — they are referenced by the Xcode project
- Do not commit the `build_*.log` files that exist at root — they are legacy artifacts pending cleanup
- Do not change `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` below `11.0` — this is the ARM64 baseline

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Open in Xcode
open OpenEmu-metal.xcworkspace

# Check current branch
git branch

# Sync with upstream
git fetch upstream && git merge upstream/master

# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b fix/your-description

# Stage and commit
git add -p   # review changes interactively
git commit -m "fix: description of what was fixed"

# Push and open PR
git push -u origin fix/your-description
gh pr create --repo bazley82/OpenEmuARM64
```
